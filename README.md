## 📖 Introduction

**Nodal** is a cutting-edge analysis platform designed to transform linear narratives—whether from text manuscripts or video content—into interactive, dynamic node graphs. 

By leveraging the advanced multimodal reasoning capabilities of **Google's Gemini 3.0 Pro**, Nodal deconstructs complex stories to reveal the underlying web of character relationships, plot progression, and thematic evolution. It bridges the gap between linear consumption and structural comprehension.
